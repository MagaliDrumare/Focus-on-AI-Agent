### AutoGen Tutorial : create Custom AI Agents 
AutoGen provides a multi-agent conversation framework as a high-level abstraction. It is an open-source library for enabling next-generation LLM applications with multi-agent collaborations, teachability and personalization. With this framework, users can build LLM workflows. The agent modularity and conversation-based programming simplifies development and enables reuse for developers. End-users benefit from multiple agents independently learning and collaborating on their behalf, enabling them to accomplish more with less work. Benefits of the multi-agent approach with AutoGen include agents that can be backed by various LLM configurations; native support for a generic form of tool usage through code generation and execution; and, a special agent, the Human Proxy Agent that enables easy integration of human feedback and involvement at different levels.

### AutoGen Studio 3.0
Multi-agent systems, where multiple agents (generative AI models + tools) collaborate, are emerging as an effective pattern for solving
long-running, complex tasks in numerous domains. However, specifying their parameters (such as models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc,.) and debugging them remains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework.

### AutoGen Studio 2.0: An advanced AI development tool from Microsoft.
AutoGen Studio is an interface powered by AutoGen, designed to simplify the process of creating and managing multi-agent solutions. Itâ€™s a user-friendly platform that allows even beginners to declaratively define and modify agents and multi-agent workflows through an intuitive interface.

### CrewAI Tutorial - Next Generation AI Agent Teams (Fully Local)
The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

### NEW HuggingGPT ðŸ¤— - One Model to Rule Them All (Is this AGI?)
New research paper by HuggingFace, where they propose a new LLM framework that brings us closer to AGI. This is called HuggingGPT. A single centralized model to control many other fine-tuned specialized models, allowing for multi-modal complex task execution.
